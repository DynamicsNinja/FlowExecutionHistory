## Features

### Multiple Flows

You are able to filter flow runs against multiple flows at the same time, so you can see everything in one place.

### Filter by Trigger Output Values

You can filter flow runs based on trigger output values. This powerful feature enables you to narrow down the results to only those runs that meet specific trigger output criteria.

### Time filters

Filter out flow runs for a period of time instead of constantly loading the next page like we are used to in run history on the Power Automate portal.

### Flow Correlation

Find out the correlation between different flows. You can easily identify which flows triggered other flows and find out their runs. Clicking on the correlation ID cell will highlight all related flows in the list.

### Export

Export flow runs history to the Excel or CSV file.

### Browser and profiles

Select the browser and browser profile that will be used when opening the run details link.
